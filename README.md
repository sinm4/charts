# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Notes:

- [ReCharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/examples/LineBarAreaComposedChart) looks good
- [ChartJS](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/) looks most pleasing out of the box
- ApexCharts also looks decent but uses class components
- [VisX](https://airbnb.io/visx) looks good
- [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/) also looks good
